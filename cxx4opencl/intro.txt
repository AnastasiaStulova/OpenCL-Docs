[[intro]]
== Introduction

This language is built on top of OpenCL C v2.0 and {cpp}17 enabling
most of regular {cpp} features in OpenCL kernel code. Most functionality
from OpenCL C and {cpp} is inherited. The following two sections of this
document describe <<diff2openclc, _the differences to OpenCL C_>> and <<diff2cxx, _the differences to {cpp}_>>.

The majority of content covers the behavior that is not documented in
the OpenCL C v2.0 section 6 and {cpp}17 specifications. This is mainly
related to interactions between OpenCL and {cpp} language features.

== The {cpp} for OpenCL Programming Language 
 
This section documents various language features of {cpp} for OpenCL in
particular:

 * any behavior that deviates from {cpp}17;
 * any behavior that deviates from OpenCL C v2.0;
 * any behavior that is not governed by OpenCL C and {cpp}.
